                    <p>DogoWalk is a pet care app designed to provide dog owners with a reliable and secure platform to find professionally trained dog walkers. The app ensures trust and safety by offering background-checked, certified walkers and real-time tracking features. Additionally, DogoWalk provides its own training sessions for dog walkers, ensuring they meet high standards of care and handling. This case study explores the user experience design process behind DogoWalk, addressing pain points and designing solutions for both dog owners and walkers.</p>

                    <p>The pet care industry is booming, especially in urban areas. With increasing pet ownership and busy lifestyles, more people are turning to dog walking services. However, studies and online sentiment reveal a significant gap in trust and transparency within this sector.</p>
                    <p>Key insights from market data and trend reports:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Over 60% of pet owners express hesitation when using on-demand pet care apps</li>
                        <li>Trust and safety are consistently rated as top concerns when outsourcing pet care</li>
                        <li>Apps like Rover and Wag dominate the market, but are often seen as transactional and impersonal</li>
                        <li>This suggests a growing opportunity for a platform that focuses not just on convenience—but relationship building and care quality.</li>
