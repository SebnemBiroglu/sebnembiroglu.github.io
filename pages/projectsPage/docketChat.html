                <div class="research-goals">
                    <p>Based on my research into the needs of everyday people facing unexpected legal issues, I developed a user persona to guide my design decisions. Meet Ece — a law student in her early 20s who balances her studies with part-time work. Although she’s gaining legal knowledge, she still finds it challenging to interpret real-world legal documents and processes, especially under pressure. When she faces issues like confusing landlord notices or contract questions, she looks for fast, reliable support. A platform like this not only empowers her with accessible legal guidance, but also boosts her confidence when navigating tricky situations. Ece’s experience reflects a growing group of young adults who are informed but still need help bridging the gap between legal knowledge and everyday application.</p>

                <div class="research-goals">
                    <p>In this project, I designed DocketChat, an AI-powered legal research platform aimed at helping users — including lawyers, judges, and legal researchers — quickly access court documents, dockets, case law, and legal opinions.
                        Through user research, I discovered that many users feel overwhelmed by complex legal terminology and have difficulty finding relevant information quickly. Based on these findings, I focused on creating a simple, intuitive interface, reducing legal jargon, offering clear navigation, and including features like AI-enhanced search, real-time updates, and the ability to escalate to human legal experts if needed.
                        The final product balances powerful AI tools with user-friendly design, making legal research faster, easier, and more accessible for everyone.
